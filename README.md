# Favorite Group Online Games

Deployed site: https://ethyl2.github.io/fav-games/index.html

I thought it might be handy to make page listing my favorite free games to play with groups online.

Uses a bit of css animation, and tailwind, too.

## Contributors wanted!

This project will became even more useful as we are able to include more of the following:

- More online games boxes in the index page. Do you know another fun group online game? If so, either add it via a pull request or contact me via email or social media and tell me all about it. Thanks!
- More game titles in store/game-words.js to be used in the game-themed lorem ipsum generator. Also, more quiz questions and quotes related to games.
- More categories in store/categories.js to be used in the Six Second Rule game.
- More fanciful, unusual images from unsplash or another free source for the Dixit Practice page, added to static/images/dixit and their file names added in store/dixit-images.js.

## Possible Future Features

- Dixit Practice page where a user is given a clue and then tries to guess the correct image.
- More game pages!
- Any other ideas?
